## Examples

### Retrieving data on a daily base

![Full workflow](https://github.com/tataille/node-red-french-holidays/blob/main/assets/catch-example.png)

```json
[{"id":"d88debded16f7c16","type":"switch","z":"59b8c1f4183c9197","name":"","property":"day-info.day","propertyType":"global","rules":[{"t":"eq","v":"0","vt":"str"},{"t":"eq","v":"6","vt":"str"},{"t":"else"}],"checkall":"false","repair":false,"outputs":3,"x":190,"y":580,"wires":[["08db052087e131ec"],["08db052087e131ec"],["7b2060ccee5932ce"]]}]
```

### Error handling

Due to the fact the plugin interact with external APIs provided by French government, external errors (missing records, connection errors..) are thrown to the node-red core. To handle the exceptions and program a new query, a __catch__ block must be added to the __node-red__ flow. Error details can be found in the exception message payload.
