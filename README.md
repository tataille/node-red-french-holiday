```

### Error handling

Due to the fact the plugin interact with external APIs provided by French government, external errors (missing records, connection errors..) are thrown to the node-red core. To handle the exceptions and program a new query, a __catch__ block must be added to the __node-red__ flow. Error details can be found in the exception message payload.

* Click the green button in the lower-left corner of the window that says "Reopen in Container".

* Wait for the container to build and start.

* Open a terminal in VS Code and run "node-red"  to start the __node-red__  server.


```bash
    node-red
```

To stop the __node-red__ server, just enter "ctrl-c" in VS Code terminal where the __node-red__ server run.

To install the module in __debug__ mode, open a terminal in VS Code and run commands:
